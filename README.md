# Finalv2

For this second checkpoint I started working with plotly with my data.  After last week's class finding the one Cardcaptor Sakura relation wheel (I'm not exactly sure what to call it), I was searching for  graph that could show relationships.  I eventually found the "Parallel Categories Diagram" in Plotly which is similar to a sankey diagram.  I first just tried graphing my data with my dataframe as is and it definitely needed some help. The first thing I did was drop all of the duplicate rows in the dataframe, as I was not showing how many times an advertiser would advertise to one user, I wanted to see the numnber of users an advertiser advertised to.  After that I realized it was still pretty unreadable with about 171 different advertisers so I decided to remove any advertiser that only advertised to one user using a mask. I then used that list of advertisers to only show entries in my DataFrame that had advertisers on the list.  This made my final product much more readable.  I then messed around a little with color and added a "Queer" category so you could see which advertisers only advertised to queer or non-queer people.

For next week, I am going to spend more time messing with this graph to see what order I need to put all of the variables.  I am also going to add more data to the DataFrame so it represents more people.  Finally I am going to try to export this graph via html(?) to display it on a Whiteboard type application.
